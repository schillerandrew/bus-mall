## Features

- randomly presents 3 products from a list of 20, and the user selects the favorite from the 3 by clicking on it
- each round of 3 products is always completely different than the previous round
- once the user has "voted" 25 times, a bar chart shows them how many views and votes each product has
- the views and votes are saved to local storage and continue to be tallied and displayed in the chart, even if the user visits the page later
